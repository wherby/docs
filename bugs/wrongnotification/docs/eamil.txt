Hi Penny,

Yes, the issue is caused by the notification of global mapping rule change. The email need to send specified approver/reviewer.  The bug will be fix ASAP.

Thanks
Steven

Hi Steven,

Please find below feedback from our team member.  Could you please check if there is any update to email notification since we update the setting to approver of mapping rules?

Best regards,
Penny

Hi Penny –  lots of our team members received the below email but no outstanding tasks showed up upon log-in. I assume no action needs to be done but just FYI, in case some changes in the setting can be done to prevent mass email from sending out.
